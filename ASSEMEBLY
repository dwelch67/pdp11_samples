See the tt01 README for more.  GNU assembler as one would expect made
up their own assembly that does not match the DEC documentation so
we have to work our way through translating between the two.

mov #30,r1      DEC immediate
mov $030,r1     GNU as, $ instead and uses C style numbers

mov @#1234,r1   DEC Absolute
mov *$01234,r1  GNU as

mov (r2),r1     DEC register deferred (indirect)
mov @r1,r1      DEC alternate syntax
mov (r2),r1     GNU as
mov *(r2),r1    GNU as also takes this as an equivalent

So in general so far it seems

- Where DEC uses #, GNU uses $.
- Where DEC uses @, GNU uses *.
- DEC defaults to octal for immediates, GNU uses C syntax.

The GNU assembler expects underscores to be added to external labels.
